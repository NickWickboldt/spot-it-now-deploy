        <h2>1. Zero Tolerance Policy</h2>
        <p>Spot It! maintains a strict zero-tolerance policy against child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and any content that exploits or endangers children. Any such content discovered on our platform will be immediately removed, and the associated account will be permanently banned.</p>

        <h2>2. Content Moderation</h2>
